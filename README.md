# titanic_ml_competition

## Introduction

Here you can find my try to the [Titanic ML competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview). I took this as an opportunity to make some experiment and to use some tools I learned during the course of Machine Learning. Obviously I could have done something differrent - and better - but these are my first approaches to work of this type, so I am happy with the result obtained.

In this repository you can find my python noteboook containing my work, the train dataset and the test dataset. The test dataset do not comprehend the 'Survived' label, and to have a score on that you will have to submit the solution to Kaggle.

## Conclusion

In the future I could modify something, or do it again to see if I have improved in the meanwhile.

For question or suggestions, don't hesitate to contact me.
