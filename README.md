# titanic_ml_competition

Here you can find my try to the [Titanic ML competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview). I took this as an opportunity to make some experiment and to use some tools I learned during the course of Machine Learning. Obviously I could have done something differrent - and better - but these are my first approaches to work of this type, so I am happy with the result obtained.

In the future I could modify something, or do it again to see if I have improved in the meanwhile.

For question or suggestions, don't hesitate to contact me.
